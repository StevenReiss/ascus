Synthesizing Programs Using Repositories

This project aims to meet the Darpa challenge using a minimum of formal semantics
and analysis by extracting information from repositories (e.g. github).

We want to explore various alternatives both to specifying what it is we want
to build and how to generate the resultant code.

================================================================================

Initial explorations:

* Using test cases to find the code
   -- looking at similar test cases

* Starting with a barebones framework and extending it from different projects
        by using context information and matching existing classes, etc.

* S6 transforms to perform a more directed search (prioritizing results) and then
        using target semantics and mappings.

================================================================================

Initial Challenge:

* Create a http server
