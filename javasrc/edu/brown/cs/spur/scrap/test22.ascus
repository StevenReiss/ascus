/**
 * This controller progresses a checkers game by acting on an instance of   {@link CheckersModel CheckerModel}. The crux of this controller's functionality
resides in   {@link #step step}, which traverses the state transition table of	<code>CheckersModel</code> one step at a time. <code>step</code> is
repeatedly called within   {@link #loop loop} until the game can not progress without external stimuli. Examples of external stimuli include a mouse click,
a timer event, or a move selection. Certain types of external stimuli have  predictable timing - <code>step</code> will indicate in its return code when
these stimuli are expected to occur. <code>loop</code> will then use this  return value to resume looping at the indicated time.  <p> We briefly describe the
functionality of <code>step</code>, as well as how this functionality depends on several configurable parameters. <ul> <li> By default, the transition from
<code>READY</code> to  <code>WAITING</code> occurs after a delay of <code>turnDelayTime</code>	milliseconds. This <i>turn delay</i> serves to improve visual
clarity for  CheckersUI, since otherwise the transition occurs too rapidly to be noticed. However, if the <code>moveOnClick</code> option is enabled for the
active	side, this transition will wait for a mouse click before proceeding.  <li> By default, the transition between <code>WAITING</code> to
<code>READY</code> occurs after the active player selects a move. However,  if the <i>turn limit</i> option <code>turnLimit</code> is non-negative, the
transition from WAITING to <code>READY</code> will occur after	<code>turnLimit</code> milliseconds, regardless of whether the active player  has finished
selecting its move.  <li> If the active player is an interactive player (as determined by  {@link CheckersPlayer#isHuman CheckersPlayer.isHuman}), the
transition from  <code>WAITING</code> to <code>READY</code> will ignore the turn limit. <code>step</code> will never  force a partially selected move from an
interactive player. </ul> <p> The design of <code>CheckersController</code> follows thread-safety  guidelines.
